## 2. Ignition our app

<details> <summary>Read</summary>

Not only React,

React, lot of other packages, lot of other library, and lot of js code making our app Fast.

npm does not have a full formüòÇ

- package.json is a configuration of out npm
- our project depends on lot of packages those packages are dependencies.
- npm take care of the version of those packages

### Bundlers :-

- most important package

what is bundlers:-

html, css, js whole code bundle together.
webpack, parcel, vite these are Bundlers.

- Create react app behind the scenes uses webpack, babel
- We will use parcel

```base
        npm install -D parcel
```

homework:-

1. Dev Dependencies (require in develpment face)
2. Normal Dependencies (use in production also)

parcel : "^2.8.3"

- ^ - npm automatcally updates its minor versions.

parcel : "~2.8.3"

- ~ - npm automatcally updates its minor versions.

package-lock.json

- record every version of the package or dependencies
- package.josn - Keeps approximate version
- package-lock.json - keeps Exact version
- search in integrity in lock.json - that is Hash whatever right now in my machine it's same version deployed in production.

node_modules

- it is huge
- parcel has own dependencies
- every package has its own dependency

### parcel is beast

- does a lot of things
- parcel needs a help of babel also, browserlist also

whatever you can generate don't put on git hub

```bash
        npx parcel index.html
```

- npm - calling a package
- npx - executing the package

CDN - react is not a good way

int termainal Ctrl+C

```bash
        npm install react
```

- see in package.json
- see in nodemodule

```bash
       npm install react-dom
```

remove cdn link
re-run

```bash
        npx parcel index.html
```

```bash
<script type="module scr="./index.js">
```

### parcel :- Read parcel docs GIVE Claps to parcelüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëè

- Dev Build
- Local Server
- HMR = Hot module Replacement
- File watching algorithm written in c++
- cashing - Faster Builds
- image optimization
- minification
- Bundling
- Compressing
- Consistant Hashing
- Code splitting
- Differential Bundling (for old browsers)
- Diagnostic
- Error Handling
- Tree shaking
- Lazy mode
- Different Dev and production bundle

Be curious

for production builds remove main : "index.js" from package.json

server also install nodemodule for its own.

```bash
"browserlist": [
    "last 2 chrome version",
    "last 2 firefox version"
  ],
```

browserlist.dev website - search last 2 chrome versions

we see this episode our own create react app.

## 3. Laying the Foundation

<details><summary>Read</summary>

### part-1

npx parcel index.html this is lengthy

we short command so in package.json

```base
        "script": {
                "start" : "parcel index.html",
                "build" : "parcel build index.html"
        }
```

If you are going to new company work on new project don't know how to start

- -> go to package.json
- -> find script
- -> you will get it the exact command to run the project

to start the project "run" is optional

```base
        npm run start
```

to build the project "run" is required

```base
        npm run build
```

Just like dom element react has react element.
kind of equelant to dom element.

react element end of the object. When they render the element to the dom it became HTML.

### part - 3

when react was build this is core of react

```base
const heading = React.createElement("h1", {id: "heading"}, "Namaste React");
console.log(heading);
```

facebook developer create JSX

- Javascript syntex to create React element
- JSX is not part of React. JSX different React is Different.
- we can write React without JSX. Bus jsx make developer life easy.
- jsx is conversion where the html and js merge together.

```base
        const jsxheading = <h1>Namaste React Using JSX</h1>;
```

this is not html this is valid jsx.
jsx- is not HTML in JS

- jsx is different
- HTML is different
- React is different
- Everything is different üòÇ

JSX - HTML like or XML - like syntex.

We code for Humans(developers) then Machine.

in browser console

```base
const number = 8;
```

```base
const heading = <h1 className="heading" tabIndex={1}>Namste React Using JSX</h1>;
```

js engine does not understand jsx. But js engine understand Ecma Script.

But how jsx work in my code

- Because of Parcel
- Even before the code goes to the js engine it is transpiled.
  and JS engine receive the code the Browser can understand.
- parcel is like manager in that it is happening by babel.
- babel is not create by facebook

JSX => React.createElement => React Element - JS Object => HTML Element(render)

Visit babel website.

- babel worklike abstract syntex tree
- not only coverting into react element. It is also work ES6 code understands in older browser.
- lot transpilation
- npm library (view library)
- go read doc in babel website.

homework

- how to use imagetag, imagesrc, anchor tag

Extension Akshay use

- prttier - code formatter
- Bracket pair colorization Toggle
- Es lint
- Better comments

### part - 4

Everythin in React are component - True

- header
- footer
- title
- card

Two tyep

- Class based components - OLD way (nobody uses now) (such a pain)
- Funtional components - New way (99.99% people use)

React funtional component is just a normal javascript function

- Function compont name it First letter capitals

```base
        const HeadingComponent = () => {
                return <h1>Namaste React Functional Component</h1>;
        }
```

this is functional component.

- a function that return a jsx code is functional components
- jsx is also react element So, a function that return a React element is React funtional component.

```base
        root.render(<HeadingComponent/>);
```

this is syntex that babel understand.

What is Component Composition :-

```base
const Title = () = (
        <h1 className="head"> Namaste React </h1>
)
        const HeadingComponent = () => {
                return (<div>
                <Title>
                <h1>Namaste React Functional Component</h1>;
                </div>)
        }
        const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
        root.render(<HeadingComponent>);
```

This is Component composition

- Component used in side Component
- You Composing two component one in another.

Arrow Function is the Industry Standard.

We can run every piece of Javascript code in that culrybraces in React.

jsx is mix of HTML and Javascript.

```base
        <div>
                {// here}
                <h1>Namaste</h1>
        </div>
```

we can put element into jsx or jsx into element function component in react.

if it create loop Browser will crash.

```base
        const data = api.getData();
        const HeadingComponent = () => {
                return (<div>
                {data}
                <h1>Namaste React Functional Component</h1>;
                </div>)
        }
```

if api has some malisious codes it will run in browser. It is called cross site script.

It can steal cookies, session value.

Bus JSX takes care of Injection Attacks.

JSX will Escape it.

Sanitizing the data and will pass it.

JSX prevents from cross site script attack for free

What are make web app fast not only React, it has babel, JSX

We don't even Deep dive into React.

## 4. Talk is Cheap show me the code

<details>
<summary>Read</summary>

### part - 1

We are Going to make food order app

- What should you use in your planning
- If is a plan is good, code is very easy to write

1. what are you going to build
2. what are process build
3. how it would look like

draw a layout of the UI in note

let us do low level design

header

- logo
- New Item
- cart

Body

- Search
- Restaurant Container
- Restaurant card

footer

- Copyright
- Links
- Address
- Contact

we can't write inline css in JSX. We can only write inline css by Javascript Object.

```base
        style={{backroundColor: "#f0f0f0"}}
```

- first curly braces for JS code
- inner curly braces for JS Object

### part - 2

Props - short form of properties

- at the end of the day a normal argument to the function
- passing props to component equals to passing argument to the function

```base
        const RestaurantCard = (props)=>{
                console.log(props);
                return (<h3>{props.resName}</h3>);
        }
```

```base
        <RestaurantCard resName="Meghana Foods" cuisins="Briyani, North Indian, Asian"/>
        <RestaurantCard resName="KFC" cuisins="Burger, FastFood"/>
```

it will print both of the props

we can write also write like this

```base
        const RestaurantCard = (resName, cuisins)=>{
                return (<div>
                        <h3>{resName}</h3>
                        <h3>{cuisins}</h3>
                </div>);
        }
```

some cool developer destructure and using like this.

```base
        const RestaurantCard = (props)=>{
                const { resName, cuisins } = props;
                return (<div>
                        <h3>{resName}</h3>
                        <h3>{cuisins}</h3>
                </div>);
        }
```

this is just javascript, not react doing this

### Config Driven UI

- The UI chennai has seperate offer, Mumbai has seperate, Kolkatta has seperate some cities don't have offer
- How UI like that

- Our website Driven by data
- this is Known as config driven UI
- If delhi has different courosal My backend api
- all UI driven by config
  - Api data is config
  - -> can be different for delhi
  - -> can be different for Mumbai
  - -> Some Plase won't show that UI
- According to the data comming from backend the UI is changed. This is known as config Driven UI.

Lot of Company Uses It.

can be set Different color of backround for various places.

UI layer, Data layer both of them makes an application

```base
        const resList = [{
                data: {
                        id: 1,
                        name: "Meghana food",
                        cuisines: ["Burger", "Biriyani", "American"],
                        avgRating: 5,
                        costForTwo: 300,
                        deliveryTime: "30 minutes",
                        cloudinary_imageid: "goevzinldbotvpn3xid1"
                }
        },
        {
                data: {
                        id: 2,
                        name: "KFC",
                        cuisines: ["Burger", "Chicken","American"],
                        avgRating: 5,
                        costForTwo: 200,
                        deliveryTime: "30 minutes",
                        cloudinary_imageid: "goevzinldbotvpn3xid1"
                }
        },
        {
                data: { id: 3,
                        name: "Burger King",
                        cuisines: ["Burger", "Biriyani"],
                        avgRating: 5,
                        costForTwo: 300,
                        deliveryTime: "20 minutes",
                        cloudinary_imageid: "goevzinldbotvpn3xid1"
                }
        }];
        <RestaurantCard resData={resList[0]} />
        <RestaurantCard resData={resList[1]} />
```

inside of the component

```base
        const {resData} = props;
return(<div>
     <h3>{resData.data.name}</h3>
     <h3>{resData.data.cuisines.join(", ")}</h3>
     <h3>{resData.data.avgRating}</h3>
     <h3>{resData.data.costForTwo/100}</h3>
     <h3>{resData.data.deliveryTime}</h3>
</div>)

```

if you put in image in website you need to use CDN,

Swiggy uses res.cloudinary.com

```base
        <h3>{res.cloudinary.com+ resData.data.cloudinary_imageid}</h3>
```

when you Build a production readu app you have to write reusable components.

Clean the mess our code write like that cool developer

```base
const { cloudinary_imageid, name, avgRating, cuisines, costForTwo, deliveryTime } = resData?.data;
```

Instead of using for(i) we can use map

```base
        <div>
                {
                resList.map((restaurant)=>(<RestaurantCard key={restaurant.data.id} resData={restaurant}>));
                }
        </div>
```

if we put key for iterated element warning will remove

Whenever you are looping anything of anylist you have to use give a key.

Container

- ->1, id 1
- ->2, id 2
- ->3, id 3

react optimize it's render cycle

why should key uniquely represent it.

suppose we didn't use key new RestaurantCard came in

If we didn't give key react don't know which RestaurantCard.

So it re-render all component.

it will treat like all RestaurantCard are same.

If you give each of them uniue id
React now id1, 2,3, 4,5 already there

so give unique key

Never Use Index as Key in react in offical documentation

not using key(not Acceptable) < Index as key (not recommended) < unique id (best practise)

</details>

## 5. Let's get Hooked

<details>
<summary>Read</summary>

Everything React can do, you can do that using normal HTML, CSS, JavaScript then why react?

The beauty of the framework (or) library is makes the developer life is Easy

Writing less code More on the webpage this is the major job of UI, Library, Framework is

react makes your coding experience make fast and optimizing something on the webpage.

The thing hapen very fast

### part-1

Before that Hooked

Best practise is seperate files for seperate component

All the source code keep on the src folder

(we can code without src folder but)

best practise is make seperate folder for every component

- first human then machine

your project have thousands of components

>        >src
>           >components
>           App.js

- -> it is not mandatory
- -> it is upon the developers, project Maintainers, upon to You

It is folled in Industry

> React folder Structure

visit website and research

- -> Grouping by features
- -> Grouping by file type
- -> Avoid too much nesting
- -> Don't Over think it

>        >src
>           >components
>              Body.js
>              Header.jsx
>           App.js

we can use jsx extension

Before import Header components from App.js we want to Export Header from Header.js file

Always Export First and Import next

> import Header from "./components/Header.js";

even if you didn't put js extension here it will work

- Whenever you have hardcoded data you never keep in components
- This is Industry Standard
- URL is also Hard coded data image logo also

Where should keep that

>       >Utils

some people use common folder

>       >utils
>         constant.js
>         mockData.js

it is default export

```base
        export default resList;
```

it is default import

```base
        export default resList;
```

it is named export

```base
        export const CDN_URL = "url";
```

it is named import

```base
        import { CDN_URL } from "./filepath"
```

- Named export can do multiple times
- default export can only do one time per file

I will Write Notes Later First I need to Complete Project for my portfolio.
